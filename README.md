## Background
[//]: # (OPTIONAL)
[//]: # (Explain the motivation and abstract dependencies for this repo)

Planzoco takes some inspiration from [poll.ly](https://poll.ly/), in that all participants can suggest and vote on an item. Where
planzoco takes it further is the inclusion of multiple questions. When organising an excursion with friends, or a
family get together, there are many questions that must be agreed apon, such as,
- Where are we going?
- What are we doing?
- How are we getting there?

Planzoco allows all participants to suggest an option, then everyone gets to vote on it.

## EaC

You may notice that there is less OpenTofu (the FLOSS fork of Terraform) code here than you might have expected.
Evoteum has an ECS base deployment platform, so the only module that each repos needs is the platform service module.
This provides a truly repeatable "golden path" deployment to ensure that everyone can focus on just getting code to
customers faster.

Other modules are defined in the tofu-modules repo, while the central platform infrastructure is defined in the
platform-infrastructure module.

We also aim to follow the "Everything as Code" practice wherever possible. We prefer to define everything in code,
including things that might not "usually" be defined in code. For more info, see the estate-repos repo, where all our
repositories are defined and maintained.
